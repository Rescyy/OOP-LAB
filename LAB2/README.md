For this lab I implemented 10 classes that would represent some key features of USSR.  
I realize the topic itself is not serious, but do not get discouraged.  
The classes simulate a pseudo real world, where each has a role for the "state" to grow.  
While the program is running, you will notice that you get a report text.  
Here you get updates of your state, letting you know the latest progress of the state.
For some processes, the output is randomized, therefore it it not a deterministic environment.
